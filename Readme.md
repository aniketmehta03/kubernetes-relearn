# kubernetes-relearn

🚀 **A personal Kubernetes practice repo**  
This repository tracks my hands-on journey as I relearn and practice Kubernetes concepts by building and managing different workloads.

## 🌟 What’s inside?

✅ **Apache server on Kubernetes**  
✅ **Django Notes App containerized & deployed**  
✅ **MySQL StatefulSet + secrets + config**  
✅ **NGINX with persistent storage and scaling**

## 🛠️ Goals

- Relearn core Kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services, statefulsets, volumes)
- Practice `kubectl` commands and manifests
- Work on real-life examples (multi-tier apps, databases, scaling)
- Document lessons and errors for future reference

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo is **not production-ready** — it’s a learning space!  
I’ll keep pushing updates, adding manifests, and experimenting with:

- Helm charts
- CI/CD with Kubernetes
- Advanced networking
- Monitoring + observability

## 🤝 Contributions

Not open for contributions (yet) — this is a personal journey.  
But feel free to fork and explore if you find something useful!

---

## 📚 Notes

I might add notes and docs under each project folder to track:
- Common issues + fixes
- Command references
- Learnings from each setup

Stay tuned!
